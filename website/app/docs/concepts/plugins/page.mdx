# Plugins

Kardinal leverages a plugin system that allows developers to encode logic of how dev versions of stateful services (databases, queues, APIs) and external services (Stripe API, Mailchimp, managed database like Amazon RDS or Neon DB) should be handled.
Plugins work by offering developers an api to write Python-based scripts that can dynamically alter Kubernetes deployment specs, providing a way to handle stateful and external services in a safer manner.

Kardinal supports a number of plugins already, with more currently in development or planned for future development. If there is a particular plugin you are interested in that is not on this list, please open a [github issue](https://github.com/kurtosis-tech/kardinal/issues) with more details.

## How It Works

1. **Plugin Execution**: Kardinal executes the specified plugins when creating or deleting a flow.
2. **Pod Spec Modification**: Plugins can modify the pod specifications, for all the dependants before it's applied to the cluster.
3. **Config Map Generation**: Plugins can generate a config map to store information for later use, particularly during flow deletion.

## Designing Plugins

Plugins are Python scripts hosted on GitHub. Each plugin should have two main functions:

1. **create_flow**: Called when creating a new flow.
2. **delete_flow**: Called when deleting a flow.

### Basic Plugin Structure

```python
# main.py

def create_flow(service_specs: list, pod_specs: list, flow_uuid, optional_argument):
    # Modify the pod specs from all dependants (all services using same plugin)
    # Generate a config map if needed
    # service_specs - the list of Kubernetes service spec json
    # pod_specs - pod spec list from the dependants
    # flow_uuid - the uuid of the flow string
    # optional_argument - you can have any number of these, passed via annotations
    return {
        "pod_specs": modified_pod_specs,
        "config_map": config_map
    }

def delete_flow(config_map, flow_uuid):
    # Perform any necessary cleanup
    pass
```

### Plugin Guidelines

- You need a `main.py` in the root of your repository with the above structure
- Modify the `pod_specs` as needed in the `create_flow` function.
- Use the `config_map` to store information that might be needed during flow deletion.
- If your plugin has external dependencies, include a `requirements.txt` file in the root of your repository.

### Example Plugin

Here's an example of a simple plugin that replaces text in various parts of the deployment spec:

```python
REPLACED = "the-text-has-been-replaced"

def create_flow(service_specs: list, pod_specs: list, flow_uuid, text_to_replace):
    modified_pod_specs = []

    for pod_spec in pod_specs:
        modified_pod_spec = copy.deepcopy(pod_spec)
        modified_pod_spec['containers'][0]['name'] = modified_pod_spec['containers'][0]['name'].replace(text_to_replace, REPLACED)

        modified_pod_specs.append(modified_pod_spec)

    config_map = {
        "original_text": text_to_replace
    }

    return {
        "pod_specs": modified_pod_specs,
        "config_map": config_map
    }


def delete_flow(config_map, flow_uuid):
    print(config_map["original_text"])
```

### Plugin Design Best Practices

1. **Documentation**: Clearly document your plugin's purpose, required arguments, and effects on the pod specs.
1. **Dependency Management**: If your plugin requires external libraries, list them in a `requirements.txt` file in the root of your repository.
1. **Error Handling**: Implement proper error handling; raise an error and a non zero exit code if the plugin fails
1. **Config Map Usage**: Use the config map to store any information that might be needed during the delete_flow operation.

## Defining and associating Plugins with Kubernetes services

In the Kardinal system, plugins are defined using a Kubernetes `service` with the `kardinal.dev.service/plugin-definition` annotation
It's important to mention this `service` will be only used for Kardinal to create a plugin and it won't represent a `service` resource in the cluster.

### Annotation Structure

The `kardinal.dev.service/plugins` annotation uses a YAML-formatted list of plugins. Each plugin in the list has four main parameters:

1. `name`: This is the GitHub repository URL of the plugin.
2. `args`: These are the arguments that will be passed to the plugin's `create_flow` function.
3. `type`: The type of service a plugin is being used for - currently the two options are `stateful` and `external` (optional)
4. `serviceName`: The name to refer to this service as in the Kardinal topology, it should be unique. (required)

A plugin repository can be used in multiple plugin definitions as long as they use different service names

Here's an example of how your plugins definition might look:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: my-awesome-plugin
  annotations:
    kardinal.dev.service/plugin-definition: |
      - name: github.com/kurtosis-tech/redis-plugin
        type: stateful
        servicename: my-awesome-plugin
        args:
          text_to_replace: "original-text"
```

### Associating Plugins with Kubernetes Services

In the Kardinal system, plugins are associated with specific services in your Kubernetes cluster using annotations. This allows you to specify which plugins should be applied to each service, providing fine-grained control over your deployment modifications.

### How to Tag a Service Spec

To use a plugin with a particular service, you need to add special annotations to your Kubernetes service specification. Here's how you can do it:

1. Open your Kubernetes service specification YAML file.
2. Add an annotation under the `metadata` section of your service.
3. Use the `kardinal.dev.service/plugins` key to specify the plugins you want to use.

Here's an example of how your service spec might look:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: my-awesome-service
  annotations:
    kardinal.dev.service/plugins: "my-awesome-plugin"
spec:
  selector:
    app: my-awesome-service
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 8080
```

You can specify multiple plugins for a single service by adding more plugin service names separated by a comma:

```yaml
annotations:
  kardinal.dev.service/plugins: "my-awesome-plugin,another-plugin"
```

Multiple services can reference to the same plugin through its service name

### Plugin Execution

When creating a dev flow, Kardinal determines which services to create a dev version of. For all services that require a dev version, Kardinal will:

1. Read the `kardinal.dev.service/plugins` annotation.
2. For each plugin listed:
   - Fetch the plugin code from the specified GitHub repository.
   - Execute the plugin's `create_flow` function, passing in the service specs, pod specs, a generated flow UUID, and any arguments specified in the `args` section.
   - Create a dev version of the service based on the pod spec returned by the plugin.

When deleting the dev flow and removing dev versions of services, Kardinal will call the `delete_flow` function on all plugins to clean up resources.
For example, in the `neondb-plugin`, the `delete_flow` operation cleans up the Neon database branch created for that dev flow.

### Plugin Annotation Best Practices

1. **Argument Naming**: Use clear, descriptive names for your plugin arguments.
1. **Plugin Order**: If using multiple plugins, consider their order as they will be applied sequentially.

By using annotations in your Kubernetes service specs, you can easily associate Kardinal plugins with specific services. This allows for powerful, targeted modifications to your deployments, enhancing the flexibility and manageability of your Kubernetes applications.

## Types of Plugins

Currently, there are two ways to use plugins in your Kubernetes application - on a stateful service inside the cluster or on an external service.
The usage of plugins for these cases slightly differs.

### Stateful Service Plugins

In order for Kardinal to guarantee data isolation and safety, Kardinal needs to know how to create "dev" versions of stateful services in your cluster.
The level of data isolation and semantics of "dev" version will be highly dependent on your service, application, and development needs.
This is where we can leverage a plugin to encode this information.

For example, say we have a `postgres` database in our cluster. When creating dev flows, we'll avoid touching the "baseline" postgres database by using the [`postgres-seed-plugin`](https://github.com/kurtosis-tech/postgres-seed-plugin) like so:

```

                created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
                updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,

            INSERT INTO public.items (id, created_at, updated_at, deleted_at, user_id, product_id, quantity)
            VALUES (1, '2024-08-02 13:02:07.656104 +00:00', '2024-08-02 13:02:07.656104 +00:00', null, '0494c5e0-dde0-48fa-a6d8-f7962f5476bf', '66VCHSJNUP', 1);

            INSERT INTO public.items (id, created_at, updated_at, deleted_at, user_id, product_id, quantity)
            VALUES (2, '2024-08-02 13:02:10.891407 +00:00', '2024-08-02 13:02:10.891407 +00:00', null, '0494c5e0-dde0-48fa-a6d8-f7962f5476bf', '2ZYFJ3GM2N', 1);

            -- Set the sequence to the correct value after inserting records
            SELECT setval('public.items_id_seq', (SELECT MAX(id) FROM public.items));
          db_name: "cart"
          db_user: "postgresuser"
          db_password: "postgrespass"
...
```

Anytime a dev version of `postgres` is called, the `postgres-seed-plugin` is called that will return a pod spec starting a fresh instance of postgres using the provided seed script.
This pod spec will then be used to create the dev postgres instance. Notice how the plugin encapsulates the semantics of the "dev" version of postgres in our instance - and can be updated in case our requirements ever change.

### External Service Plugins

External services are any service outside a clusters that a service inside depends on. This can be managed databases or queues or APIs like Stripe or Mailchimp that a service inside depends on. (Note external services can also be stateful!)
Using plugins to handle dev versions of external services works very similarly.

The difference is that the plugin annotation gets added to the service spec of the service that depends on the external service. Accordingly, when writing the plugin, the plugin will be modifying the pod spec of the dependent service.

For example, say we have a `cartservice` in our app that depends on an external [Neon](neon.tech) DB. When creating dev flows, we'll avoid touching the "baseline" Neon database by using the [`neondb-plugin`](https://github.com/kurtosis-tech/neondb-plugin) like so:

```

                NEON_FORK_FROM_BRANCH_ID: ""
...
```

Anytime a dev version of `cartservice` is called, the `neondb-plugin` is called. The plugin will create a dev database branch, forked off of main. It will then return a modified pod spec starting a dev version of the cartservice that points to the dev database branch.
Notice how here, the plugin annotation goes on the service depending on the external service and this is the deployment.template spec being modified, in this case, the `cartservice`.
Also, notice we add `type:external` and `serviceName:neon-postgres-db` to tell Kardinal this service is external and how to refer to it.
