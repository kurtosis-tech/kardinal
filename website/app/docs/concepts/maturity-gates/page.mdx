# Maturity Gates

Maturity gates are a way for developers to control data and traffic access throughout their team's software development lifecycle.

_A maturity gate is a definition for when a version of a service can be considered stable or secure enough to get exposed to more production-like data and traffic_, and can pass to the next [flow](concepts/flows) (from QA to staging, for example).

Some examples of maturity gate definitions, paired with the flows they may have:

- No pull request (early development version) → [Isolated Dev Flow](use-cases/isolated-dev-sandbox-flows)
- Pull request, unmerged → Preview Flow
- Merged, CI passes → QA Flow
- Passed Manual Review from the QA team → Staging Flow

Maturity gates are highly configurable, so you can design any qualifications necessary to define your own maturity gates and the flows they correspond to.
