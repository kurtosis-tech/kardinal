# Maturity-Based Access Controls

Maturity-based access controls are how teams configure [flows](concepts/flows) so that every engineer can get access to the right traffic and data at the right time for effective delivery.

With maturity-based access controls, you define the level of exposure to production data and traffic along with the level of isolation that a deployed version of a service has.

This can be done by combining the following configuration options:

### _Traffic Source_

1. Staging Traffic
2. Dev Traffic (only the dev or QA team can generate traffic)

### _Traffic Access Controls_

1. Redirect (the new version completely handles the traffic)
2. Mirror (the new version gets a duplicate of the traffic, and the output is not given to end-users)

### _Data Layer_

1. Obfuscated Production Data
2. Staging Data
4. Dev (Notional) Data

### _Data Isolation Modes_

1. Read/Write (full access to the database)
2. Shared Read, Isolated Write (full read access to the database, but writes happen in an isolated commit layer)
