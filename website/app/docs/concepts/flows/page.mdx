# Flows

In Kardinal, a flow is an ephemeral environment that developers can use for development, testing, or QA.

The default flow in Kardinal is called `stable`, and typically contains the latest versions of each service that you have in your staging cluster, i.e. the latest changes that are about to be promoted to production.

When Kardinal creates a flow, it will deploy the set of services that encompass the changes being made for a given feature. Kardinal will also create an ingress point for the developer to use.

Any communication made through the ingress point will be routed to the versions of the services that are a part of the flow. Any services that are a part of the application, but aren't being changed as a part of the feature, will still be available from the `stable` flow.

This basic use case is similar to deploying new versions of services in a separate namespace and sharing everything else with a shared dev cluster. However, Kardinal gets more interesting once you're fully onboarded and have defined your entire service dependency graph.

Once your service dependency graph is defined, Kardinal can provide state isolation between flows via [stateful service plugins](./concepts/plugins).

The cost savings of this use case (isolating state between flows) can reach into the millions of dollars for large organizations who use ephemeral environments or isolated dev sandboxes.

With Kardinal, for every dev, test, or QA need, you will only ever deploy the minimum possible resources needed to test the feature, and you will reuse everything else across your development team.
