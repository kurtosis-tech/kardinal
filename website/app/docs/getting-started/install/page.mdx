# Getting Started On Your Own App

Kardinal has two main requirements for an application to work with it:
1. Distributed tracing is implemented in the application
2. Every service can define its dependencies as annotations in the deployment spec

If you can't yet fulfill these requirements, our [demo app](getting-started/demo) is a great way to experience Kardinal until those two prerequesites are met.

If you have distributed tracing in your application, and you're able to define dependencies per service in your deployment spec, you can install Kardinal today.
