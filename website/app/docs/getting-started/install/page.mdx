# Installation

In this guide, you'll:
1. Install the Kardinal CLI on your laptop
2. Set up a development Kubernetes cluster
3. Install the Kardinal Manager on your cluster, using the CLI

### Step 1: Install Kardinal

To install Kardinal, run the following command:

```bash
curl get.kardinal.dev -sL | sh
```

### Step 2: Set up a development Kubernetes cluster

All you need is a Kubernetes cluster with Istio enabled, and `kubectl` installed on your machine, pointing to your cluster.

For instructions on how to set up a local cluster that meets these requirements, see below:

<Collapsible title="Minikube with Docker">

Install the following on your machine:

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/)
- [Kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/)
- [Istio](https://istio.io/latest/docs/setup/getting-started/)



Then, run Minikube with Istio enabled:

```bash
minikube start --driver=docker --cpus=10 --memory 8192 --disk-size 32g
minikube addons enable ingress
minikube addons enable metrics-server
istioctl install --set profile=default -y
```

### Step 3: Deploy the Kardinal Manager to your cluster

Make sure that `kubectl` is pointing to your cluster, and then run the following command:

```bash
kardinal manager deploy kloud-kontrol
```

Now the Kardinal Manager is deployed in your cluster, you're ready to set up your baseline application and start creating flows.

### Step 4: Deploy the baseline version of your application

To deploy your baseline application, run the following command:

```bash
kardinal deploy -k <path-to-k8s-manifest-annotated-for-Kardinal>
```

where `<path-to-k8s-manifest-annotated-for-Kardinal>` is the path to the Kubernetes manifest file for your application, annotated according to our [getting started guide](/docs/getting-started/own-guide).

To try out a demo application, you can use the following command:

```bash
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kurtosis-tech/kardinal-playground/main/obd-demo.yaml
kardinal deploy -k obd-demo.yaml
```

Then, run `kardinal dashboard` to see the dashboard for your demo application. To create a demo flow, run:

```bash
kardinal flow create frontend kurtosistech/frontend:demo-on-sale -s productcatalogservice=kurtosistech/productcatalogservice:demo-on-sale
```
