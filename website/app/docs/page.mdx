# Introduction

Kardinal is an _open-source multitenancy framework_ for Kubernetes-deployed applications that enables engineers to efficiently do development, test, and QA work within a single stable Kubernetes cluster.

Previously, developers would spin up separate Kubernetes clusters where every resource is duplicated for development, test, and QA workflows. With Kardinal, developers deploy only the absolute minimum resources necessary to validate changes within a single, prod-like cluster.

Kardinal achieves this by defining development "environments" by the path a request takes through a single cluster, in which every version of a service that is needed for development work across the team is deployed and available.

Within the cluster, services (including databases and queues) are reused as much as possible between separate development or testing workflows.

There are a few techniques outside of Kardinal for isolating dev, test, and QA environments. To see how Kardinal fits in to other options, see the table below:

| Isolation method | Level of Isolation | Cost | # of Duplicated Resources |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Separate VPCs | Most coarse-grained | Highest Cost | Highest |
| Separate Kubernetes Clusters | Coarse-grained | High Cost | High |
| Separate Namespaces (vclusters) | Fine-grained | Low Cost | Low |
| *Separate Traffic Routes (Kardinal)* | Most fine-grained | Lowest Cost | Lowest |
