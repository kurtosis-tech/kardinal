# Introduction

Kardinal is a framework for creating extremely lightweight development environments within a shared Kubernetes cluster.

In Kardinal, an environment is called a "[flow](concepts/flow)" because it represents a path that a request takes through the cluster. Versions of services that are under development are deployed on-demand, and then shared across all development work that depends on that version.

To test a new feature, Kardinal will deploy the set of services that are changing that feature. Then, when you create a flow, any requests related to testing that feature are routed to those versions.

To get started, [install Kardinal](getting-started/install) and then [create your first flow](getting-started/own-app).
