# Introduction

Kardinal is a framework for creating extremely lightweight development environments within a shared Kubernetes cluster. In Kardinal, an environment is called a "[flow](https://kardinal.dev/docs/concepts/flows)" because it represents a path that a request takes through the cluster. Versions of services that are under development are deployed on-demand, and then shared across all development work that depends on that version.

**Why choose Kardinal?**

- **Ephemeral Environments**: Spin up a new environment exactly when you need it, and just as quickly spin it down when you’re done.
- **Minimal Resource Usage**: Only deploy the services you’re actively working on. Kardinal takes care of the rest, so you don’t waste resources.
- **Stateless & Stateful**: Works for services backed up by persistant storage so you can connect to all of your favorite databases.
- **Flexible Flow Types**: Whether you need to test a single service or an entire application, Kardinal has you covered:
    - Single-Service Flows: Perfect for when you’re tweaking just one service.
    - Multi-Service Flows: Ideal for when your feature involves multiple services.
    - State-Isolated Flows: Great for features that need their own databases or caches.
    - Full Application Flows: For those times when you need end-to-end testing with full isolation.
- **Cost Savings**: Kardinal can help you save big by avoiding unnecessary resource duplication. It’s a game-changer for teams looking to cut costs.
- **Open source**: Kardinal is open source, so use it however fits best within your workflows
