# Introduction

Kardinal is an open-source framework for creating extremely lightweight ephemeral development environments within a shared Kubernetes cluster. Between dev environments, Kardinal shares every microservice or database that can be feasibly be shared, optimizing for cloud costs and fast spin-up/tear-down.

To see how much you would save using Kardinal for your particular architecture, check out the [cost saving calculator](https://kardinal.dev/calculator).

**Why choose Kardinal?**

- **Ephemeral Environments**: Spin up a new environment exactly when you need it, and just as quickly spin it down when you’re done.
- **Minimal Resource Usage**: Only deploy the services you’re actively working on. Kardinal takes care of the rest, so you don’t waste resources.
- **Flexible Environment Types**: Whether you need to test a single service or an entire application, Kardinal has you covered:
    - Single-Service Flows: Perfect for when you’re tweaking just one service.
    - Multi-Service Flows: Ideal for when your feature involves multiple services.
    - State-Isolated Flows: Great for features that need their own isolated databases or caches.
    - Full Application Flows: For those times when you need end-to-end testing with full isolation.
- **Cost Savings**: Kardinal can help you save big by avoiding unnecessary resource duplication. It’s a game-changer for teams looking to cut costs. Check out [this calculator](https://kardinal.dev/calculator) to run your own calculations.
- **Open Source**: Kardinal is open source, so use it however fits best within your workflows
