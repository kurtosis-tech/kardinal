# Architecture

Kardinal is built with a sidecar - control plane architecture.

There are two kinds of sidecars:

- _Stateless service sidecar_

  Deployed alongside services that are stateless, and thus can be reused across flows without risk of corrupting data in other flows.

- _Stateful service sidecar_

  Deployed alongside services that have state like databases, queues, and caches. Implements rules like “shared read, isolated write”, “isolated read, isolated write”, and “shared read/write” which allow the stateful service to be maximally reused across flows without breaking isolation.

Both of these sidecars are deployed inside of your environment, next to the corresponding stateless or stateful services.

The **control plane** is the single interface where the behavior of the Kardinal sidecars is managed. It enables developers to configure and monitor their [flows](concepts/flows) and [maturity gates](concepts/maturity-gates) for themselves and their organization.
